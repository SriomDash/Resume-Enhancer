# Resume-Enhancer

**Enhance your resume using AI-driven insights to align with job descriptions and improve your chances of landing interviews.**

## 📌 Overview

Resume-Enhancer is a tool designed to optimize your resume by analyzing it against specific job descriptions. Leveraging AI, it provides suggestions to highlight relevant skills, experiences, and certifications, ensuring your resume stands out to potential employers.

## 🗂️ Project Structure

The repository is organized into three main directories:

- **`backend/`**: Contains the server-side logic, handling API requests, and integrating AI models for resume analysis.
- **`frontend/`**: Houses the client-side application, providing an intuitive interface for users to upload resumes and job descriptions.
- **`model/`**: Contains a sophisticated OCR and NLP pipeline that analyzes the resume and feeds the analysis report, along with the complete resume, to the LLM.

## 🚀 Features

- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Utilizes advanced language models to assess and enhance resumes.
- **Job Description Matching**: Aligns your resume content with specific job requirements.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Interactive frontend for easy uploads and instant feedback.
- **Modular Design**: Separation of concerns with distinct backend, frontend, and model components.
